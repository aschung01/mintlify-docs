title: JsonMatchMetric
description: A metric class that computes the similarity between two JSON-like structures.
---

## Overview

The `JsonMatchMetric` class provides a way to compute the similarity between two JSON-like structures. It compares two dictionaries or lists, considering the structure and content of nested objects. It can optionally consider list order and ignore specified keys.

## Attributes

- `consider_list_order` (bool): If True, list order is considered in comparisons. Defaults to False.
- `ignore_keys` (List[str]): A list of keys to ignore during comparison. Keys are normalized to lowercase with spaces replaced by underscores.
- `binary_judge` (Callable): An LLM-based binary judge for scoring non-exact matches.

## Methods

<ParamField path="compute" type="method">
  Compute the similarity score between the gold standard and prediction.

**Parameters:**

- `pred` (Dict[str, Any]): The prediction to compare against the gold standard.
- `gold` (Dict[str, Any]): The gold standard data item.
- `inputs` (Dict[str, Any]): Additional input information (not used in this implementation).
- `trace` (Optional[Dict]): Additional trace information (not used in this implementation).
- `metadata` (Optional[Dict]): Additional metadata (not used in this implementation).

**Returns:**
MetricResult: The computed similarity score and any intermediate values.

**Note:**
This method normalizes both inputs, compares their structures recursively, and returns a MetricResult representing the overall similarity. It handles nested dictionaries and lists, applying special comparison logic based on the `consider_list_order` attribute.

</ParamField>

## Usage

To use the `JsonMatchMetric` class, create an instance and call the `compute` method with the prediction and gold standard data items.

Example:

```python
from ape.common.metrics import JsonMatchMetric

metric = JsonMatchMetric()

result = await metric.compute(inputs={"text1": "Hello, world!", "text2": "Greetings from the cosmos!"}, gold="Hello, world!", pred="Greetings from the cosmos!")
print(result)
```
